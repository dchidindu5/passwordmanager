# passwordmanager

This is a password manager that generates passwords and stores them in a file using Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) encryption.
Still on the Process...........

### AES256.cpp
This cpp program uses the RSA,  ECB mode of operation and ANSI X9.23 padding method to encrypt files. Although the original file was written in C but I rewrote and refactored it into C++, more changes coming soon

### WIFPASS.cpp
This C++ program shows all previously connected WiFi networks and their passwords requires reading from the Windows registry and using command-line utilities. Works only on windows for now
